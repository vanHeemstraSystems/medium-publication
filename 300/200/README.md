# 200 - Step 2: Customize your publication layout

Once you create your Medium publication, you can start customizing your publication homepage. On your homepage, add a publication title or image logo on your header, as well as your background image. Additionally, you can add sections where your submitted stories will appear, customize your navigation bar, as well as make separate pages called feature pages.

You can learn more about customizing your publication layout in [this section](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001431688-Layout) of our Help Center.
