# 400 - Step 4: Submit stories to the publication

Time to fill your publication with content. You and your publication editors and writers can submit stories to your publication. Submitted stories will appear on your publication homepage, based on what publication sections you've set up.

For a step-by-step guide on adding your content to your publication, see [this article](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213904978).

Stories submitted by publication writers need to be reviewed and approved by editors to be included in your publication. This process is explained [here](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004848948-Review-submitted-draft-or-post).
