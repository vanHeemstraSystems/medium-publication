## Getting started with a Medium publication

This guide will tell you more about Medium publications and will walk you through the process of creating your own publication.

### What is a Medium publication?

Medium publications are shared spaces for stories written around a common theme or topic, usually by multiple authors.

As such, publications can be created for many different purposes. Some example uses of Medium publications include:

- An online magazine, a publication with a fixed publication staff that posts stories around a specific topic
- A community publication, a publication that accepts stories published around Medium 
- A company blog, a publication that is created specifically to share company news
- A collection of individual stories by a single author that are parts of a larger whole

### Key features of Medium publications

- Dedicated publication homepage with a customizable layout

Each publication has their own customizable publication homepage, where publication editors can feature stories published in their publication. In the publication's settings, you can add a header with a title and/or logo, set up a number of sections with customizable layouts, and add feature pages which act as tabs housing specialized content.

- Support for multiple contributors: writers and editors & story submission system

Each publication is owned by a single user accountâ€”the publication's owner. The owner account has full rights to manage the publication and can add other users as publication editors and writers.

- - Editors can review, edit and publish or reject stories submitted by writers, as well as add their own stories, modify the publication's layout, and add or remove publication writers.
- - Writers are regular contributors who can submit their stories to the publication.

- Newsletter system

Publication editors can write and send custom email newsletters to the publication followers to connect with their readers and further build their audience.

- Detailed stats page

Publications have a detailed stats page that allows publication editors to easily check how all the submitted stories are performing.

- URL in the format: medium.com/your-publication-name
